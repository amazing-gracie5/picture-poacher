This Python program will download images from a website given the URL.

This program asks the user for a URL. It then inspects the source code of the website found at the URL and downloads any images found to the user's computer.

This project was completed by Grace Simonson (repo owner), Charles Hebert, and Laura Sevilla as a final project in an introductory coding class at the College of Wooster in fall of 2021.
